# claude-cli-template

Simple CLAUDE.md file to preserve continuity across sessions.

## Problem

Claude code *is* great. However, due to session limits and/or interruptions, it often loses the ability to follow instructions and stay on the task.

## Why this repo

This project template, although far from perfect and with no guarantees whatsoever, helped me keep Claude focus on the task at hand and work on long projects over multiple sessions without major issues. Sharing HTH.

## Does it work?

It did for me. Anyway, Claude **will** end up ignoring instructions from time to time, especially when the context gets too long.

When that happens, here's what helped me:
1. Stop the session / interrupt the current run.
2. Ask Claude to re-read the CLAUDE.md file and related documents.

**Tip**: a context cleanup, and/or a fresh session start before 1+2 seemed to help too.
